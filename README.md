## Description

The idea for this app was born when Youtube reccomended me anime openings quiz.
Actually, I didn't know some of ones marked as easy (because I didn't watch these animes) but I knew
a bunch of openings marked as hard. I came to conclusion that there are no easy and hard ones, there
are those you have listened to and the rest. Then I created this app that knows what you have
watched and makes personelized quiz.

## Requirements

`KEY` environmental variable - Youtube Data API key
